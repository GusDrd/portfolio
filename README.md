The new v2 of the website was loosely designed in figma using elements from the v1 figma project.  
Both versions were fully implemented using Vue.js only.

Props to [vue-inline-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-inline-svg) for implementing a simple way to inject .svg files' content directly inside the HTML.

> The v2 project is still in development and more features are comming soon!
